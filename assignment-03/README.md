# Assignment-03
This directory contains the python code to get the value of the key from the given nested object (i.e. dictionary).

## Prerequisites
Below prerequisites must be fulfilled for the successful execution of code.

### Software Requirement
Code in this directory are meant for use with Python 3.x (check the version using `python3 --version`) and pip3 (check the version using `pip3 --version`). If you don't have the compatible version, download it from official python repository.

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= 3.11.1
- [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) >= 23.3.1

### Bootstrap Virtual Environment
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is a tool that creates isolated Python environments. These isolated environments can have separate versions of Python packages, which allows you to isolate one project's dependencies from the dependencies of other projects.

**Linux**
```
    cd assignment-03
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Script Execution
Follow the below steps for the execution of python script.

- **Step-01:** Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/anupam-sy/assignment-solutions.git`
- **Step-02:** Setup the python virtual environment using [Bootstrap Virtual Environment](#bootstrap-virtual-environment).
- **Step-03:** Activate the python virtual environment and navigate to the directory `assignment-03` to install the requirements using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- **Step-04:** Execute the python script: `python get_key_value.py`
